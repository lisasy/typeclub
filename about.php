	 				<h2>What is TypeClub?</h2>
					<p>We serve the Wesleyan University community by using design to create greater connectivity and break down communication barriers between the vast diversity of campus initiatives and organizations happening at Wesleyan.</p>
					<p>TypeClub was founded in January 2012 by Carlos Sanchez '14 and Lisa Sy '13. Once we began advertising our services, more and more students and campus organizations from different fields and interests have contacted us, requesting help on their logo, publicity campaign, marketing materials, and such.</p>
